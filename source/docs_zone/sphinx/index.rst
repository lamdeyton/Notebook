| Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful documentation, written by Georg Brandl and licensed under the BSD license.
| Sphinx uses ``reStructuredText`` as its markup language,
 and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText 
 and its parsing and translating suite, the ``Docutils``.
